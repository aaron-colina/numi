# Templates

Templates are ready-to-go full view snapshots that users can drop into their offers without having to start from scratch.

Templates have a `category` which defines which folder it will go into. 

- category can be a string for now
- templates have a `name`
- templates are associated with a theme 
- can be global

- [ ] templates contain basic `views` snapshots that are loaded into Offers once 
- [ ] templates are associated with a global Theme config that is copied into the org if selected
